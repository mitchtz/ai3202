----Second Heuristic----
Equation:
x = abs(coord1[1] - coord2[1])
y = abs(coord1[0] - coord2[0])
return int(min((10 * (x + y)),(14*math.sqrt(pow(x, 2) + pow(y, 2)))))

Reason for choosing:
I thought this heuristic would produce a good solution because it accounts for
the movement cost difference of diagonal moves and horizontal/vertical moves.
It uses the Manhattan distance and multiplies it by 10 since Manhattan distance
uses right angles and straight lines to estimate distance. It then calculates
the linear distance to the goal (straight line to goal) and multiplies by 14,
since the linear path usually is diagonal. Finally, the heristic chooses the
minimum of these two calculated values and uses it as the estimated distance.

Performance:
Both heuristics came up with the same path to the goal, with the cost being the same.
In World1, the Manhattan distance evaluated/changed square costs 64 times.
In World1, the second heuristic evaluates.changes square costs 62 times.
In World2, both heuristics evaluated/changed square costs 62 times.

Performance Analysis:
This means that the second heuristic was only a little more efficient in the
first world, and only in terms of squares evaluated/changed. The paths and
final costs ended up being the same for both heuristics.
